<h1>Analyzing Music Events in LA</h1>
<h2>Project Objective</h2>
<h4>What problem are you solving></h4>
<p>Los Angeles is among the top cities Ticketmaster provides tickets for. It needs to be more clear as to which venues host the most shows and which genres are commonly performed at those venues as well as if the venue has an impact on ticket prices. To gain a better understanding, I will be analyzing 200 music events in Los Angeles and determine trends and patterns in venue popularity and price ranges.</p>
