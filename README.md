<h1>Analyzing Music Events in LA</h1>
<h2><em>Project Objective</em></h2>
<h4>What problem are you solving></h4>
<p>Los Angeles is among the top cities Ticketmaster provides tickets for. It needs to be more clear as to which venues host the most shows and which genres are commonly performed at those venues as well as if the venue has an impact on ticket prices. To gain a better understanding, I will be analyzing 200 music events in Los Angeles and determine trends and patterns in venue popularity and price ranges.</p>

<h4><em>How are you solving this problem?</em></h4>
<p>I will solve this problem by using Ticketmaster’s API to retrieve the 200 music events in LA. I will use their API to get the artist's name, genre, subgenre, event date, venue, venue address, and minimum and maximum price. I will then explore the data to identify popular venues and genres and determine whether there is a correlation between prices and venue popularity. These insights can provide valuable information for stakeholders, such as event organizers, entertainment companies, venue owners, and artists, to make decisions and improve their event planning. </p>
