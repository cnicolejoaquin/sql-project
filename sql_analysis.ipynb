The highest maximum ticket price of 179.5 and average maximum price of 100.0 belongs to the rock genre shows hosted by the Greek Theatre. On the other hand, the lowest maximum ticket prices can be seen at the Moroccan Lounge and The Echo for the rock genre shows. Rock genre events also have a higher average maximum ticket prices compared to the pop genre events at The Wiltern. This could suggest that rock events have a higher demand among the audience at the in demand venues, leading to higher ticket prices. However, the average minimum prices for pop genre shows are higher than the rock genre shows at The Echo and The Wiltern. This could indicate that pop events at these venues are priced higher across the board. It is recommended for the events with lower budgets, especially for those who are looking to host rock shows, it would be best to consider booking at The Moroccan Lounge, which offers lower ticker prices for rock genre events.
